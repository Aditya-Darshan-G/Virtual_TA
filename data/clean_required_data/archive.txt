It is open source and extremely popular for statistical analysis. In recent years, Python has become the de facto standard for data modeling. However, R still plays an important role for many analysts.

And to get the
data set, you need to know where it is. This is what we will be covering in the first module. How do you discover data? There are three things that you will learn in this module. The first is, what are the different sources of data sets? Where can you find them? The second is, what are the different kinds of data sets? Structured, unstructured and semi-structured. Third, in each data set, what are the different kinds of values that you will find? This will give you a sense of locating the kind of data set that you want, either on the internet
or within your organization or even within your phones. Sources of Data Awesome public datasets Google dataset search Kaggle datasets Data.gov and Data.gov.in Datameet Types of datasets Structured data has a schema: Databases, Spreadsheets, Forms, Shapefiles Semi-structured data has a flexible schema: JSON, HTML, Email Unstructured data has no schema: Text, Images, Audio, Video DBF opener MapShaper lets you view Shapefiles Types of values Categorical values may be: Boolean: True or False Unordered: No order, like colors Ordered: Order, like ratings Cyclical: Like days of the week Unstructured: Like names, images Numerical values may be: Integer: You can add or subtract Real: You can multiply or divide Composite values have an internal structure Temporal: Date, Time Spatial: Latitude, Longitude, Shapefiles Structured: JSON, XML with schema Specialized: IP addresses, URLs, Email addresses, Phone numbers, etc. Week Summary Based on what you have learnt in this module, you should be able to do two things: find data and understand what type of data it is. Both of these are powerful skills. The more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to.
Therefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building. The other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with.
Structured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work.
You don't have to extract information from it.
Numerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure.
So you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort. Sample questions Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality. (It has 4,898 rows.) What is the highest pH value of the red wines? (ANS: 4.01) What's the official data portal of Russia? (ANS: https://data.gov.ru/?language=en ) Are research papers structured, semi-structured or unstructured? (ANS: Semi-structured. They have author names, abstracts, keywords, etc. but most content is free-form.) Are book titles categorical or composite? (ANS: Categorical. They don't have an underlying structure.)
