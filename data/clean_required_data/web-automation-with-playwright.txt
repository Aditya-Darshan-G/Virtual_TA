Web Scraping with Playwright in Python Scrape JavaScript‑heavy sites effortlessly with Playwright. ( youtube.com ) Playwright offers: JavaScript rendering : Executes page scripts so you scrape only after content appears. ( playwright.dev ) Headless & headed modes : Run without UI or in a real browser for debugging. ( playwright.dev ) Auto‑waiting & retry : Built‑in locators reduce flakiness. ( playwright.dev ) Multi‑browser support : Chromium, Firefox, WebKit—all from one API. ( playwright.dev ) Example: Scraping a JS‑Rendered Site We’ll scrape Quotes to Scrape (JS) —a site that loads quotes via JavaScript, so a simple requests call gets only an empty shell ( quotes.toscrape.com ). Playwright runs the scripts and gives us the real content: ```python /// script dependencies = ["playwright"] /// from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright def scrape_quotes():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        # Channel can be "chrome", "msedge", "chrome-beta", "msedge-beta" or "msedge-dev".
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True, channel="chrome")
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/")
        quotes = page.query_selector_all(".quote")
        for q in quotes:
            text = q.query_selector(".text").inner_text()
            author = q.query_selector(".author").inner_text()
            print(f"{text} — {author}")
        browser.close() if name == " main ":
    scrape_quotes()
``` Save as scraper.py and run: bash
uv run scraper.py You’ll see each quote plus author printed—fetched only after the JS executes.
