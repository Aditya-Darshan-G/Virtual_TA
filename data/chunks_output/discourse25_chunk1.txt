re not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner. Regards, Ajit

No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by. Kind regards

@carlton any updates on the Project 1 results?

We are releasing them today. You will get an email with lots of goodies in it Kind regards

carlton: lots of goodies in it It is more frightening now…

If we failed in project1 then we will be awarded free marks in Project2 Please conform that @carlton at least give us some awards for our hard work (Summer special offer), what do you say?

I think something heavy is coming… But it’s 9:30, and nothing’s here yet.
