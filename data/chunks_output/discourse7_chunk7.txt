nâ€™t received any mail regarding this Project1 marks. @Jivraj @carlton

@carlton Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again .

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: d0f14a872042 , but i had never provided this docker image then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id. Please, look over it. Regards, Harsh Jaiswal 23f1001995
