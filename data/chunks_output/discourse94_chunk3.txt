carlton: You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. @22f3002539 Please refer to above reply. Kind regards

Dear @s.anand sir, For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time?? I will make sure I submit it in both places next time. I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course. I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission image 747Ã—473 15 KB
