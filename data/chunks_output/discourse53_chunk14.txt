ook into this matter on urgent basis.

Dam… Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I’m still getting dragged into this …

But still this is a huge Problem … jkmadathil: LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #

Great! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too.

Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!

Seeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir’s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult.

You will survive. Just watch tonight’s session.
