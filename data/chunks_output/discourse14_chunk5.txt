Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous. For instance: forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data. but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?

Let’s wait for their response. I submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini Can you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides with Quiz 2. With many ambiguities unresolved it’s hard to solve this and study for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that’s not your problem). Thanks
