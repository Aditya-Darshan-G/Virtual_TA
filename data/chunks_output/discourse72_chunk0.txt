@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm. Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like Is the GitHub repo public? Does it have an MIT license? Does it have a DockerFile? Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.
