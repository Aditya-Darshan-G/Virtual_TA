@23f1002630 - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone. What happened? I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

@s.anand @Jivraj I’m still facing the issue.

i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.

OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right.
