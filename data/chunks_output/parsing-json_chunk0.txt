Parsing JSON JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object. This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing: | Tool | Extract from JSON... | Why |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| jq | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing |
| JMESPath | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax |
| ijson | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently |
| Pandas | JSON columns in Python | Fast analys
