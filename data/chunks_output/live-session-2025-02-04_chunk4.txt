14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct? A14: If you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same. Q15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why? A15: That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost. Q16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed? A16: Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes. Q17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate? A17: It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process. Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough.
