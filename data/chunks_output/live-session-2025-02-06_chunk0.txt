Live Session: 06 Feb 2025 Q1: In this GA4 session, what's new compared to previous GAs? A1: The trajectory has moved from hard to easy. This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones. Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets? A2: This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The IMPORTHTML function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel. Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage? A3: I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube. Q4: What do the parameters in the IMPORTHTML function mean? A4: The four parameters are: URL, query (either "list" or "table"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python). Q5: How does the IMPORTHTML function automatically find the table? A5: It finds the table based on the index you provide.
