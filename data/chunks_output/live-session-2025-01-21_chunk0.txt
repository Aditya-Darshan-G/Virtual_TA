Live Session: 21 Jan 2025 Q1: How much depth of knowledge is needed for the tools in the TDS course, specifically for GA1 and GA2? A1: The goal is to give you sufficient proficiency to execute the purpose of the tools, not to make you an expert. The focus is on GA1 and GA2 because of the approaching deadline. Basic knowledge will suffice; how deep you go is up to you. The biggest challenge is usually reading and understanding documentation. These sessions are designed to help you overcome that hurdle. Q2: What is the tool to create the API? A2: FastAPI. It will be demonstrated in this session. Q3: Will there be a review of the previous sessions? A3: Recordings are available on the YouTube playlist. Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today.
