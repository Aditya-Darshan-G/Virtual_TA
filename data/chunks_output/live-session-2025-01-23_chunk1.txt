Q4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course? A4: You'll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data.

A5: First, set up a git repository and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using python -m venv <env_name> . Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., .\env\Scripts\activate ). Install Flask using pip install flask . Create a .gitignore file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a vercel.json file with build instructions for Vercel.
