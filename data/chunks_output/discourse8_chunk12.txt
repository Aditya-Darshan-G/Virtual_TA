justice and academic integrity.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldnâ€™t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request. Thank you

@carlton sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this Thanking you waiting for your answer
