the equivalent of calling a function inside another in programming languages. We'll use sort to sort these IP addresses. That puts the same IP addresses next to each other. ```python Preview the SORTED IP addresses from the logs !cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | head -n 5
``` 100.20.65.50
100.43.111.139
101.100.145.51
101.115.156.11
101.115.205.68 There are no duplicates there... maybe we need to go a bit further? Let's check the top 25 lines. ```python Preview the SORTED IP addresses from the logs !cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | head -n 25
``` 100.20.65.50
100.43.111.139
101.100.145.51
101.115.156.11
101.115.205.68
101.126.25.225
101.132.248.41

101.44.160.177
101.44.160.177 OK, there are some duplicates.
