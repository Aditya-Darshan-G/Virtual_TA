sonably deterministic tasks. Your assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain‑English tasks, carries out the required (multi‑step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre‑computed expected results. Create an API Write an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints: POST /run?task=<task description> Executes a plain‑English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output. If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases GET /read?path=<file path> Returns the content of the specified file.
