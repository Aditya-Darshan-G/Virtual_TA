curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
 -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
 -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
 -F "file=@abcd.zip" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: answer that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example: json
{
 "answer": "1234567890"
