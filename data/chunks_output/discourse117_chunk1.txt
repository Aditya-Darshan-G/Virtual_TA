collaborating with you all! Update: here is a video explaining the process - https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared Best regards, Avinash Shrivastava

Hi Avinash, Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project. Kind regards

Thanks @carlton I would definitely refine it.

Testingâ€¦ please ignore
