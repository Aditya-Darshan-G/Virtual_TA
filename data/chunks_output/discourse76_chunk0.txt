Hello @carlton and @Jivraj and @s.anand sir It is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something decent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project. Thanks Vikram

@carlton @s.anand Yes Sir please extend the project deadline.

yes, it is quite difficult and also the people who have done this course in previous terms are able to help just because of the difficulty. please extend the deadline or give out some resources.

Yes @s.anand , @carlton , The project is complex, and an extension would really help reduce our stress and let us submit better work.
