sing a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling. Q7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application? A7: You pass them in the URL itself. For example, localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29 . The application then reads the parameter from the URL. Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error? A8: Several things could cause this. Ensure that: The prices dictionary is defined globally, not within a function. The prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time). The application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity). You are using the correct key in the JSON response ( .keys() ). Q9: How do I use Docker? A9: Docker creates lightweight, self-contained images that run inside a Docker engine.
