Please post any discrepancies related to project1. @carlton Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate? All the image ids we evaluated were what you submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated. How to fix bugs in our scripts Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 .
