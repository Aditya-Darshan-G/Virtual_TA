extraction from the LLM response Code execution in a subprocess Result interpretation by the LLM Error handling and retry logic if needed This demonstrates the core agent loop of: Planning (generating code) Execution (running the code) Reflection (interpreting results) Adaptation (fixing errors if needed) Agent Architectures Different agent architectures exist for different use cases: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions Reflexion : Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules Plan-and-Execute : Creates a plan first, then executes steps Real-World Applications LLM agents can be applied to various domains: Research assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information Coding assistants that write, debug, and explain code Data analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data Customer service agents that handle queries and perform actions Personal assistants
