ossible to have written solutions to all 5 assignments , instead of just live sessions. I have certain pending questions from the first 5 assignements.

Please quickly arrange a live TDS session to explain this project. There are a lot of doubts and questions in our minds.

Please also give access to the answers for GAs. So that we can evaluate our api with the correct answers.

@carlton sir, is there any bonus marks for code uniqueness and extra tasks like project 1

If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?

Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api? If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?
