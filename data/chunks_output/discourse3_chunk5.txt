d given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0. Screenshot 2025-02-07 201316 1859×960 88.4 KB and the same happened for the 3rd assignment

Please refer to this post. Tds: assignment is not submitting Tools in Data Science Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. 
The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside the seek portal. 
As stated in multiple places in discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. 
Kind regards

Only 1st Graded assignment scores are visible on dashboard. I have submitted 2nd and 3rd GA before the deadline but still it showing “not submitted” on the seek portal…

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as 4.25 , but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored 7.25 shown after submission.
