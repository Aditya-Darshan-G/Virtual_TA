not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time. 
Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. 
The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside se… Kind regards

Dear Bhavanagv, The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal. Kind regards

I had submitted the assignment still it’s shwoing that my score is 0 and that i have not submitted the assignment. Can you please look into it as i had saved my answers as well timely.
