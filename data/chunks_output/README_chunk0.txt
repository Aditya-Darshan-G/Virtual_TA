Tools in Data Science - May 2025 Tools in Data Science is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches
popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production. This course exposes you to real-life tools Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.

But one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?

These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:

- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.
- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.
- You learn to write a log parser over weeks.
