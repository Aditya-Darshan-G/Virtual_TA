Live Session: 23 Jan 2025 Q1: How can I compare two files using the command line? A1: You can use the diff command in bash, or the git diff command if you've initialized a git repository. The diff command shows the differences between two files directly. git diff compares commits in a git repository. Q2: I'm having trouble viewing my GA1. It's showing zero ones. Can you help? A2: Let's look at your screen. It appears there are different timestamps. I'll help you troubleshoot. Q3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line? A3: I used a bash script that combines the find command (to locate files of a specific type, like .txt files) and the mv command (to move them). The find command searches the current directory ( ./ ) for files ( -type f ) and the -exec option executes the mv command on each file found. The curly braces {} are placeholders for the filenames.
