Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301 331×314 12.3 KB what is the error here?? sir @Jivraj

I have the Same doubt.

@22f3001315 @21f3002277 @24ds2000024 – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this: Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4 FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there.
