e. While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.

Nicely highlighted the concern of all students. TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those with non-technical background.
