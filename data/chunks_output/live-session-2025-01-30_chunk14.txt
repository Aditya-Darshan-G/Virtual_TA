: We can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won't be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only. Q40: My first doubt is, can we use httpie instead of requests ? A40: Yes, you can change it to httpx . I'm not sure about httpie . It's a command-line tool. I've never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn't matter much because it's just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don't know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it's possible to use it in Python, but I don't know. requests is better. If it's complicated, it's not a good tool. At the end, it's also using the requests module. Q41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long? A41: That's the dimension it uses to represent a word.
