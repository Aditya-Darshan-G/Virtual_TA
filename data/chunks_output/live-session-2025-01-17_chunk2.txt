uld use students[2][name] . JSON allows hierarchical data storage, making it easy to retrieve specific values. Q6: How does JSON get loaded on a website (e.g., Discourse)? A6: Websites often fetch JSON data from backend servers. The instructor shows an example on the Discourse website, where different data (weekly, yearly) is loaded based on the request parameters in the URL. Multiple filters can be added to the URL to refine the data fetched. Q7: How can I use Python to access JSON data from a URL? A7: The instructor demonstrates using the requests library in Python to fetch JSON data from a URL. The response status code (e.g., 200 for success) indicates whether the request was successful. The JSON data is then accessible as a Python dictionary. The instructor uses Postman to show how to send API requests and view the JSON response. Q8: What is Postman and how does it work? A8: Postman is a tool that acts as an intermediary between you and an API.
