m is also on 15 February. We would be grateful if the deadline could be extendedâ€¦

Please at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension.

Kindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really helpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks increasing the odds of our submission. @carlton @s.anand

Indeed, even i am stuck in project parts and a lot of them. EXTEND !!!

Kindly consider our request to extend the deadline, as many students have their GATE exam on Saturday.
