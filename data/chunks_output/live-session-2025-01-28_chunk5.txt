How do I use the OpenAI LLM? A13: You'll use it through a proxy. You'll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We'll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code. Q14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI? A14: All IITM students (including BS students) have free access to the Pro version of Perplexity AI for one year. Use your IITM email address to register. Q15: In the LLM section, the prompt engineering section mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it even once. The key was generated, but I didn't use it. What should I do? A15: We'll cover this in a later session. Q16: The textbox in question 3 doesn't appear. I think there's a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it's not being accepted. Should I refresh? A16: We'll cover this in a later session. Q17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project.
