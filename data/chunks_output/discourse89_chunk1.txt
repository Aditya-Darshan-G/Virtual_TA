the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.
