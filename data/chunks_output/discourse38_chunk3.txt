image 474×646 36.2 KB @carlton @Jivraj Sir I gave ROE TDS exam and even submitted it and got many correct answer but it is showing absent in my dashboard.

@carlton @Jivraj My result is showing absent please clarify it.

I am experiencing the same issue. I ensured that my submission was completed and saved before the deadline. @carlton @Jivraj

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless) I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit. My roll number is 24F1001631.
