Function Calling with OpenAI Function Calling allows Large Language Models to convert natural language into structured function calls. This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems. OpenAI supports Function Calling -- a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how. Here's a minimal example using Python and OpenAI's function calling that identifies the weather in a given location. ```python /// script requires-python = ">=3.11" dependencies = [ "httpx", ] /// import httpx
import os
from typing import Dict, Any def query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
 response = httpx.post(
 "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
 headers={
 "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}",
 "Content-Type": "application/json",
 },
 json={
 "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}],
 "tools": tools,
 "tool_choice": "auto",
 },
 )
 return response.js
