marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this. Regards: Akash

@carlton I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile.

Good evening @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Sir, I hope you are well According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade.
