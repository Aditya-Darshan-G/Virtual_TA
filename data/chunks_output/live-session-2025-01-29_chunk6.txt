terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here... A10: It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is. Q11: Is my screen visible? In the Vercel question, sometimes it shows correctly, and now it's showing an error. It's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also... A11: There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment.
