If you use the documentation that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided, there's documentation there. If you use that documentation, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. Q22: This was in ROE last term. I'm getting an error. How? A22: This was a really fascinating question.
