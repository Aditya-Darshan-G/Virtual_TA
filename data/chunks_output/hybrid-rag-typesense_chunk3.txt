Auto-embedding : the embed block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document. GET /collections/notes : checks existence. POST /collections : creates the collection. POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace : bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly. Expected output: A JSON summary string like {"success": X, "failed": 0} indicating how many docs were imported. (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.) 4.
