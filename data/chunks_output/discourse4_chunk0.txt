image 1296×158 7.29 KB For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next " Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as 2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected.
