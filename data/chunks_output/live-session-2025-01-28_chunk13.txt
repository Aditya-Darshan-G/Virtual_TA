re session. Q42: What about text extraction? A42: We'll cover this in a future session. Q43: What about Base64 encoding? A43: We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API. Q44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that? A44: Yes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would send it as a Base64 encoded URI. We'll cover this in a future session. Q45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study? A45: Yes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we've put this together for you. We'll also demonstrate and do working examples. Q46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I've already told the TA, but haven't received a response. A46: The Wednesday session cannot be moved.
