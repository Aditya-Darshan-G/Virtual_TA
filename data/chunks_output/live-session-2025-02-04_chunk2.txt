s review your code. You're trying to send a request using the OpenAI module, which won't work. You need to send the request through an API proxy. Q9: I tried using an API proxy, but I still got errors. A9: Let's focus on getting the basic functionality working. We'll create a simple application and send a POST request using Thunder Client. Q10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23? A10: Those lines are for allowing requests from external servers. You can list the servers you want to allow. If you use * , anyone can access the application. It's better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from server1 and server2 , you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name. Q11: I'm stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. A11: Let's review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository.
