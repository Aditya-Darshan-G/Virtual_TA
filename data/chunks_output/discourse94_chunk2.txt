ar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time? Thanks

@23f2005471 Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it). Kind regards

Respected Sir/Madam, I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this image 1463×795 64.3 KB

carlton: You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it.
