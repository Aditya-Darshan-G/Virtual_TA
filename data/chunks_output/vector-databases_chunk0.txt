Vector Databases Vector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently. Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON'T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are: chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025 qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025 lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025 faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025 milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025 weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025 In addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example: DuckDB : Supports vector search with vss . SQLite : Supports vector search with sqlite-vec . PostgreSQL : Supports vector search with pgvector .
