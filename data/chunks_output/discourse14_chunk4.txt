Kindly update us regarding the status of Q1 & Q2 @carlton @Jivraj

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini Dear TDS Team, There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention: Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance. The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.
