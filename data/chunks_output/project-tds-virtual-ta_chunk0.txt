Project: TDS Virtual TA Create a virtual Teaching Assistant Discourse responder. Background You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras' Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the Tools in Data Science course. Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on: Course content with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025. TDS Discourse posts with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025. Scrape the data To make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source. Create an API Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at https://app.example.com/api/ . The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.
