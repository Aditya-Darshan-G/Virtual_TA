The code is working, but I'm getting a null output instead of a list of integers as requested. A3: Let's see your screen. The Flask application might be running fine as intended, but you might not be seeing the output. Sharing your screen would help me understand what's happening. You are getting a null output because you are not using a virtual environment. Let's create one. Q4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version? A4: Yes, you have to specify the version. But you don't have to manually type the requirements.txt file. You can use a single-line command in Python: pip freeze > requirements.txt . This will create the file with all the libraries and their versions in your virtual environment (or global environment if you don't have a virtual environment). Q5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I'm using Vercel CLI. A5: Let's try python -m venv venv in PowerShell.
