## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.
