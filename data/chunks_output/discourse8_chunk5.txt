ing considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton , we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.

@carlton sir , This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ? Kindly consider

same for me also … Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand.
