Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created soon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover these. Syllabus kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time Any mock or resource to practice from? additional tips, if any

Modules 1 - 5 Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame. We will have some past ROEs as practise … watch sessions Kind regards

Thanks for the answer @carlton Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ? P.S.
