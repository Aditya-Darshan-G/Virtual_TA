cipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding.
