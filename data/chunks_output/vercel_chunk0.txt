Serverless hosting: Vercel Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that don't need to run all the time . Here are some common real-life uses: A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear.
