uld have copied the questions

live session gmeet link is not available?

After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult.

where can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this mock roe ? thanks

When will it reopen?

dear @carlton when will yesterdayâ€™s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?

@23f2003413 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration.
