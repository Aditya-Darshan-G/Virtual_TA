Separate sessions will be held to cover this. Q6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data? A6: Nominatim is an API used for extracting geolocation data. The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., "Delhi") and specify the desired format (JSON).
