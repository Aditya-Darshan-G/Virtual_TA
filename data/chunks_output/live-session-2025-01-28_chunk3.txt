roject. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics. Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available? A9: Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done. Q10: What's required for grading? A10: Your repository must meet these criteria: It must exist and be publicly accessible. It must have a license file (MIT license). It must have a valid Dockerfile. The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command. The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository. It doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you're developing it. Just make sure it's public when you submit.
