Network Analysis in Python You'll learn how to use network analysis to identify clusters and connections between nodes in a dataset, covering: Network Construction : Build a network from the IMDB database, where nodes represent actors and edges represent shared movie appearances. Clustering : Apply clustering techniques to detect communities within the network, using scikit-learn's network library. Matrix Operations : Utilize matrix operations to efficiently analyze actor relationships and interactions. Community Detection : Implement algorithms to identify and interpret clusters, examining how different actor clusters are connected. Application of Findings : Explore practical applications of network analysis, such as social network analysis and its potential uses in various domains.
