One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves: Anthropic Google OpenAI Here are some best practices: Use prompt optimizers They rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore: Anthropic Prompt Optimizer OpenAI Prompt Generation Google AI-powered prompt writing tools Be clear, direct, and detailed Be explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture. BAD : Explain gravitation lensing. (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.) GOOD : Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how itâ€™s observed and its significance in astronomy.
