deadline. Can they be shown? A6: I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section. Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself? A7: Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it. Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step? A8: Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics. Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub.
