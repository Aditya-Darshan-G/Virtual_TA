). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today. Q4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do? A4: NGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time. Q5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround? A5: You can do it without a premium version. The only time you might have an issue is if you're using Codespaces and run out of the 125-hour limitation. Students have free access to GitHub. Q6: What is the tool to create the API? A6: FastAPI. Q7: Are the scores from the initial check (9/10 or 10/10) final, or will they be evaluated after submission? A7: Whatever you last submitted is your final score.
