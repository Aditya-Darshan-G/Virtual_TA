needed to execute that function. Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information? A10: You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application's design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data. Q11: How can we integrate a voice model? A11: You can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application. Q12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application? A12: We'll demonstrate this in a future session by creating another function and packaging the entire application into a Docker image. Q13: What is the role of prompt engineering in this process? A13: Prompt engineering is less about a specific science and more about understanding how the system works to write effective prompts that yield the desired results. The course will cover this in more detail.
