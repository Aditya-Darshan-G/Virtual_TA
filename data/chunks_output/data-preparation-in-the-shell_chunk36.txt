 2 101.44.162.166 That's useful. 101.2.187.83 from Colombo visited 7 times. But I'd like to know who visited the MOST. So let's sort it further. sort has an option --key 1n that sorts by field 1 -- the count of IP addresses in this case. The n indicates that it's a numeric sort (so 11 appears AFTER 2). Also, we'll use tail instead of head to get the highest entries. ```python Show the top 5 IP addresses by visits !cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | uniq --count | sort --key 1n | tail -n 5

 101255 136.243.228.193 WOW! 136.243.228.193 from Dataforseo, Ukraine, sent roughly HALF of ALL the requests! I wonder if we can figure out what User Agent they send.
