carlton same issue, My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error and Evaluation log file is MISSING. Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started. I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
