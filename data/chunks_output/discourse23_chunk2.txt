the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards

Sir, Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query. I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself). I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou!

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb.
