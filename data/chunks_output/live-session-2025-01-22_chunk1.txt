gies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma? A3: Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task. Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online? A4: For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab. Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why? A5: A 404 error means the page isn't found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging. Q6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer.
