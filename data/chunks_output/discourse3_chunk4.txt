same thing with my assignment even though i submitted it

Scores will soon be pushed to seek portal, till then it will show 0.

Same for me…deadline is over and assignment not submitted…

same issue here as well

Yes, same observation for my assignment as well.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside the seek portal. As stated in multiple places in discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. Kind regards

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.
