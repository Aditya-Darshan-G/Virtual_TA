should work. Anything similar to "bicycle" should work. Q37: My last question is how can we pass multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately? A37: I think this is the way you can pass multiple words. This should get us two different vectors. It's a list. The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle. Q38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON? A38: No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for biycle . Q39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face? A39: We can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course.
