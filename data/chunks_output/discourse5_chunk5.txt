URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile ) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation.
