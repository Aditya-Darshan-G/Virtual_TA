github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network. kind regards kind regards

@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop . Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.

@22f2001640 in that case a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080 Please try one of these: Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.
