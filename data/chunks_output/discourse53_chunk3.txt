Yes sir please look into this

@Anand @Bharathi Yes ma’am please pay attention to our concern.

Yes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course. Please consider this request. @carlton , @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj , @Anand

Yes @s.anand sir @jkmadathil sir @Bharathi Mam, Plss look into this as this is becoming too too hectic ans stressful now Mam.

Right, I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept. I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock. I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it.
