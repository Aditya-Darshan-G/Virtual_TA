Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL? A26: It can be any URL. The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL. Q27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module? A27: The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM. Q28: For task 3, what is the expected output? A28: The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You'll need to execute that code using the subprocess module. Q29: Is there a time frame for completing the project? A29: We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later. Q30: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6.
