stion about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean? A20: Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35. Q21: So, for this one, I don't get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else? A21: You just say "yes" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark. Q22: Why isn't it reflecting? A22: It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet. Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key.
