heir embeddings separately in the JSON? A29: No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for biycle . Q30: Can we get a 3x1,1056 dimensional array? A30: You won't get it directly, but you can store it in whatever format you want. You can store it in an array. I don't know how to convert JSON to an array. Q31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad? A31: Sure. Let's say I'm using a certain model for creating embeddings. Let's say that model contains a billion words. It will check the similarity of a word (like "kitten") with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry.
