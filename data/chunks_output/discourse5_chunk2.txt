ciated. Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi, Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

You talking about me or @23f2000345 ?

Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir? My GitHub repository for Project-1: GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds Thanking You Just attaching the mail I recieved. Screenshot 2025-04-12 104211 1429Ã—750 71 KB
