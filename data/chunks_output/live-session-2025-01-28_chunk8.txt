b yet. Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed? A23: No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API. Q24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can't I? A24: The free OpenAI account doesn't give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens. Q25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen? A25: No need to share your screen. I'll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That's how your project will have to work. Q26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay? A26: No, you don't have to pay. Q27: I have a few more questions.
