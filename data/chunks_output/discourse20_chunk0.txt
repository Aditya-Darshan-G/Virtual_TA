@carlton can you give me some advice regarding preparation for end term exam.

any question papers for preparations and on what basis the questions would come

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Hi, We have 6 days for ET. I request you to share module weightage (if it’s not secret). Please release mock as early as possible because this term course content has been changed so pyqs won’t help much. Thanks Sujay D

@carlton , please release the mock or give us the proper resources. The resources in the course introduction and the pyqs have no similarities. Many questions come from other topics, such as MLT and many others. Those who didn’t complete it find it too difficult. Please don’t keep us in delusion.

Going through GA’s would be good idea.

Yes sir please it will help us to prepare better for end term.

Yes sir we all are facing the same problem.

The Tuesday and the Thursday session will cover end term including a mock. End term is usually very easy for TDS.
