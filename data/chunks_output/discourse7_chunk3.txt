me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389

We will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation.

Any suggestions for my case sir ? I’m really tensed.

22f3002933: I have noticed that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is ARM . This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error . This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine. @carlton same issue, My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor).
