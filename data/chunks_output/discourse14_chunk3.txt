gnment 6. It looks like multiple options are correct in the given options. Any guidance or hint, on how to arrive at the right answer will be helpful. Thanks and regards. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Yeahâ€¦Even I am facing the same issue. Out of the 4 options provided, 3 options are correct in my case both for Q1 & Q2, but both these questions are single-choice questions. Kindly look into it and help us out @carlton !

I guess for both Q1 & Q2, we need to find the option that is having stronger correlation (positive/negative). Please correct me if I am wrong.

Any updates on these? I am too facing the same issue. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

In GA6 for first 2 questions 3 out of 4 options are correct. Even the question is not clearly asking anything.
