onment). Q5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I'm using Vercel CLI. A5: Let's try python -m venv venv in PowerShell. If you are using a virtual environment, it will only return the libraries specifically present in that environment. Since you are currently using a global environment, it returns every library. Q6: Have you tried the optional exercise I gave you for the Flask API (Zodiac sign one)? A6: No one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person's month of birth and return their zodiac sign. Q7: The main problem is that I'm spending almost 2-3 days on the TDS assignments. The GAs have 10-18 questions on average. A7: I understand. The GAs are time-consuming. If you get some time and are in the mood, you can work on the optional mini-project. You can have many more types of ideas and execute them using Flask API. Q8: Currently, I'm not in the directory that contains the Vercel file (vercel.json).
