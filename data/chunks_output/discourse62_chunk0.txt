@carlton @s.anand Release of Project 2 has been delayed by 3 days, and release of Assignment 6 has been delayed by 10 days. Could you please clarify if the submission dates will be changed accordingly? I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well. Please let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic).

@Yogesh GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days for submissions. We do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet. Kind regards

@carlton If possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.

Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc.
