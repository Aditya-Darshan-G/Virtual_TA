``` Now, you can run the evaluations and see the results. ```bash Execute all tests npx -y promptfoo eval -c promptfooconfig.yaml List past evaluations npx -y promptfoo list evals Launch interactive results viewer on port 8080 npx -y promptfoo view -p 8080
``` PromptFoo caches API responses by default (TTL 14 days). You can disable it with --no-cache or clear it.
