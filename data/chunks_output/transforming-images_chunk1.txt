``` Key features and techniques you'll learn: Image Loading and Saving : Handle various formats with automatic conversion Basic Operations : Resize, rotate, crop, and flip images Color Manipulation : Adjust brightness, contrast, and color balance Filters and Effects : Apply blur, sharpen, and other visual effects Drawing : Add text, shapes, and overlays to images Batch Processing : Handle multiple images efficiently Memory Management : Process large images without memory issues Basic Image Operations Common operations for resizing, cropping, and rotating images: ```python
from PIL import Image async def transform_image(
 path: str,
 size: tuple[int, int],
 rotation: float = 0
) -> Image.Image:
 """Transform image with basic operations."""
 with Image.open(path) as img:
 # Resize with anti-aliasing
 img = img.resize(si
