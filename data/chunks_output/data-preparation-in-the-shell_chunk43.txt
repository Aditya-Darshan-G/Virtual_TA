That gives me a rough sense of who's crawling my site. DataForSEO Apple Google Anthropic Bing PetalBot Convert logs to CSV This file is almost a CSV file separated by spaces instead of commas. The main problem is the date. Instead of [31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500] it should have been "31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500" We'll use sed (stream editor) to replace the characters. sed is like grep but lets you replace, not just search. (Actually, sed can do a lot more. It's a full-fledged editor. You can insert, delete, edit, etc. programmatically. In fact, sed has truly remarkable features that this paragraph is too small to contain.) The regular expression we will use is \[\([^]]*\)\] . The way this works is: \[ : Match the opening square bracket. \([^]]*\) : Capture everything inside the square brackets (non-greedy match for any character except ] ). \] : Match the closing square bracket. BTW, I didn't create this. ChatGPT did . sed "s/abc/xyz/" FILE replaces abc with xyz in the file.
