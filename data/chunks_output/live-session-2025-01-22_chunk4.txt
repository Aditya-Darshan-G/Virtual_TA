It's not a separate project like in other courses. Q12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade? A12: No, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise. Q13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form? A13: Yes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository. Q14: I'm using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I'm not getting the correct answers.
