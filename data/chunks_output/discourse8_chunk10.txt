cy is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief â€” grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton sir please look into this

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Yes sir , we have completed all the previous ga but not able to do week 7 , we feel that the bonus should be given to all on the basis of ga and not only on week 7 . Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request .
