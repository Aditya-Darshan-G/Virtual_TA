Live Session: 28 Jan 2025 Q1: Can I ask a question about the graded assignment for week one? A1: I'll try to answer it at the end of the session if there's time. We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session. Q2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now? A2: No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later. Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course? A3: Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools. Q4: What is the concept behind Project One? A4: Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive.
