raded assignment 1 - Submission not shown Tools in Data Science @Muthupalaniappan It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question. 
You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. 
Kind regards Please refer to this post. Kind regards

Hi Mandy, Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released). Kind regards

I have done my GA1 and scored 10/10 still it’s showing 0 on my dashboard.
