JavaScript code work on the entire site, or just the specified area? A18: The JavaScript will work on the entire site because the DOM structure is a tree. However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure. Q19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information? A19: HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs). Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data? A20: The code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements. innerText gives the text content of an element, while innerHTML gives the entire HTML code. innerText is generally preferred for data extraction. Q21: Are there other commands or attributes besides innerText ? A21: Yes, there are other attributes. text is similar to innerText , but innerText is more reliable. Always use innerText if text doesn't work.
