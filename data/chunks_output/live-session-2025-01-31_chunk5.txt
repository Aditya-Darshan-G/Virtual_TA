ndle the UUID generation to ensure uniqueness? A17: The UUID library generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation. Q18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application? A18: Instead of using absolute paths ( os.path ), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments. For deployed applications, you would typically use a .env file to store sensitive information like API keys. Q19: What is the overall approach to building this application? A19: The approach is to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities to translate natural language prompts into structured data that your application can process. This allows for a more natural user experience without the need for a complex UI.
