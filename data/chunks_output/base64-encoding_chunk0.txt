Base 64 Encoding Base64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats. Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min): Here's how it works: It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4) There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters) Common Python operations with Base64: ```python
import base64 Basic encoding/decoding text = "Hello, World!" Convert text to base64 encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== Convert base64 back to text decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode() # Hello, World! Convert to URL-safe base64 url_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG
