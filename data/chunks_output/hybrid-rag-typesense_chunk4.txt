re-run until all chunks are processed.) 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question Now, we can use a single curl against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a hybrid search : ```bash
Q="What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?" payload=$(jq -n --arg coll "notes" --arg q "$Q" \
 '{
 searches: [
 {
 collection: $coll,
 q: $q,
 query_by: "content,embedding",
 sort_by: "_text_match:desc",
 prefix: false,
 exclude_fields: "embedding"
 }
 ]
 }'
)
curl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \
 -H "X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key" \
 -d "$payload" \
 | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \
 | llm -s "${Q} - \$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes." \
 | uvx streamdown
``` query_by: "content,embedding" : tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity. sort_by: "_text_match:desc" : boosts exact text hits. exclude_fields: "embedding" : keeps responses lightweight. curl -d : posts the search request.
