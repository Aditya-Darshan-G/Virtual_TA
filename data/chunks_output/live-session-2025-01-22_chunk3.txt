The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email. Q9: For the GitHub question, if I've signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem? A9: There shouldn't be a problem. The instructor recommends using your IIT email for evaluation purposes. Q10: In the graded assignment 2, image compression, I'm getting an error: "Could not process the image. Is it browser supported? Image pixels do not match the original." I've tried several ways, including using Photoshop to ensure the image resolution is the same. What's wrong? A10: The image size should be less than 1,300,000 bytes. The instructor will make a note of this issue and investigate. The error may be browser-related, so trying a different browser might help. The instructor also requests the Discourse link be shared. Q11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default? A11: The TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added.
