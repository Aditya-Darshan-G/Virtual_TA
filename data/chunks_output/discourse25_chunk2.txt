do you say?

I think something heavy is coming… But it’s 9:30, and nothing’s here yet. Taking their time, I see!

We have marks but we are sending you a package of items as well, for your benefit.

We have been waiting for you for a month… and our patience is wearing thin 1306411745_marco_telugu-jpg-1 1280×720 133 KB

sir its not showing anything for me, ive got no mail, what should i do?

Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 11.24.19 pm 811×206 29.2 KB You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email. i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25 Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

Sir can you check and say if I passed or not. The link that I submitted for project 1 in the gform contains two links. I wrote ‘and’ between two website link. My mail id: 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding Project 1 results.
