The response from OpenAI will include the function name and its required parameters in JSON format. Q7: How does the program use the OpenAI response? A7: Your application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application. Q8: Is the order function dependent on the above-written cell? A8: Yes, the order function uses variables defined in previous cells. Q9: How is the JSON response handled? A9: The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function. Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information? A10: You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information.
