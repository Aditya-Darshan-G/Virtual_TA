Hi @carlton , Will this session be recorded and shared later? It conflicts with live session of BA and that session is specially told that It will not be recorded.

@carlton sir, I too prefer a recording. I did not even attend the session due to personal work which I couldn"t avoid. Pls support

@kushabarodekar @Muthupalaniappan As usual recording will be uploaded to youtube.

This is the recording of the session.
