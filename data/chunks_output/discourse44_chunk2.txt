on Prof The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays” Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”? grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_21.44.39_on__14-02-2025__003253 1920×1816 271 KB

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked- Thank you

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.
