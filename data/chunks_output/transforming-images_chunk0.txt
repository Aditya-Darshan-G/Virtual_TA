Transforming Images Image Processing with PIL (Pillow) Pillow is Python's leading library for image processing, offering powerful tools for editing, analyzing, and generating images. It handles various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) and provides operations from basic resizing to complex filters. Here's a minimal example showing common operations: ```python /// script requires-python = ">=3.11" dependencies = ["Pillow"] /// from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter async def process_image(path: str) -> Image.Image:
 """Process an image with basic enhancements."""
 with Image.open(path) as img:
 # Convert to RGB to ensure compatibility
 img = img.convert('RGB') # Resize maintaining aspect ratio
 img.thumbnail((800, 800))

 # Apply enhancements
 img = (ImageEnhance.Contrast(img)
 .enhance(1.2))

 return img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN) if name == " main ":
 import asyncio
 img = asyncio.run(process_image("input.jpg"))
 img.save("output.jpg", quality=85)
