but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: Character Encodings : Different ways to represent text in computers ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you'll encounter: ```python Reading files with explicit encoding with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
 text = f.read() Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') Detecting file encoding import chardet
with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f:
 result = chardet.detect(f.read())
print(result['encoding'])
```
