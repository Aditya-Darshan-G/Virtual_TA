for end term.

Yes sir we all are facing the same problem.

The Tuesday and the Thursday session will cover end term including a mock. End term is usually very easy for TDS. A look at prior end terms is a good indicator of how easy they are. Kind regards

@Carlton With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion. I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns? Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?

I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on.
