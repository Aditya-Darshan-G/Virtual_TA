will the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.) @Jivraj sir

Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement?

Mostly problem statement like different cities etc

Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test set like in the first project.

my question is some graded assignments have image files as a answer, so should our api return files as the answer or like can you clarify what type of answers we need to work on?

I guess yes, our APIs should return photos if required

@all Keep posting your doubts here we will have answers to all of your doubts In Thursdayâ€™s session.
