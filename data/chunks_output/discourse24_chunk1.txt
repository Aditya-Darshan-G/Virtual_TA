Screenshot 2025-01-23 151614 1281×125 18.1 KB sir @Jivraj after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?

Hi Guddu , I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ? command that I used : uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.
