LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act LLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems. What Makes an Agent? An LLM agent consists of three core components: LLM Brain : Makes decisions about what to do next Tools : External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution) Memory : Retains context across multiple steps Agents operate through a loop: Observe the environment Think about what to do Take action using tools Observe results Repeat until task completion Command-Line Agent Example We've created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that: Takes a task description from the command line Generates code to accomplish the task Automatically extracts and executes the code Passes the resul
