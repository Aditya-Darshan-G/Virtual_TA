@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I would like to share that we have successfully completed TDS Project 2 , solving 46/57 cases dynamically via Azure after deployment ! We also tested it with our friends’ GA questions , and it’s working as expected. This project was a team effort by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate our project to TA and Anand Sir in a Google Meet session on March 31st (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th). If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.

Hi @23f2005702 @lakshaygarg654 Firstly, congratulations on your success. And surely you can demonstrate your project. It would be great if you demonstrate it in today’s live session at 8pm.
