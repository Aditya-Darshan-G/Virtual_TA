SELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders; Processing in Chunks We handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics. sql
