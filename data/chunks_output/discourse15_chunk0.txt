Is it compulsory to use microsoft powerpoint? Can we use google slides?

We will be using scripts to check the submissions. You will have to use PowerPoint. Kind regards

Hi @carlton , I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this? image 1393×657 67.8 KB

There is another dataset provided for the other records.

image 1227×791 78.2 KB Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.

@ Jivraj In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”

Thanks a lot for pointing out and sorry it’s my bad missed it.

Item is there in other sheet we might have to join them
