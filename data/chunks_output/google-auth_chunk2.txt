 import uvicorn
 uvicorn.run(app, port=8000)
``` Now, run uv run app.py . When you visit http://localhost:8000/ you'll be redirected to a Google login page. When you log in, you'll be redirected back to http://localhost:8000/ Now you'll see the email ID you logged in with. Instead of displaying the email, you can show different content based on the user.
