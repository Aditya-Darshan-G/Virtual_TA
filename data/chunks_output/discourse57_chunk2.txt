hi @carlton how are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance!

You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form. I will also add the same in the student seek portal. Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either! The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team. Kind regards

3 questions:- will the questions and dataset be available after time limit? will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions? will the live solving video lecture be recorded?

23f1002382: will the questions and dataset be available after time limit? They will be available after the live session has finished.
