e project. Q11: Will we get a screen recording of this session? A11: Yes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube. Q12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)? A12: It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute). Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools? A13: Right-click on the browser and select "Inspect." This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser. Q14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools? A14: The Console tab lets you run JavaScript. This will be covered later in the session, in the context of CSS selectors.
