IDE: GitHub Codespaces GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-hosted development environment built right into GitHub that gets you coding faster with pre-configured containers, adjustable compute power, and seamless integration with workflows like Actions and Copilot. Why Codespaces helps Reproducible onboarding : Say goodbye to “works on my machine” woes—everyone uses the same setup for assignments or demos. Anywhere access : Jump back into your project from a laptop, tablet, or phone without having to reinstall anything. Rapid experimentation & debugging : Spin up short-lived environments on any branch, commit, or PR to isolate bugs or test features, or keep longer-lived codespaces for big projects. Quick Setup From the GitHub UI Go to your repo and click Code → Codespaces → New codespace . Pick the branch and machine specs (2–32 cores, 8–64 GB RAM), then click Create codespace .
