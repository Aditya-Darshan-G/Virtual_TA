hers (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.

This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them. If you passed, don't enroll again The course is public, so you can always audit it.

Also, registering again for the course [does not improve marks much](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-you-should-almost-never-register-for-tds-improvement-if-you-have-passed-it/173625). We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.
