nly copy the tools in the virtual environment? A22: Yes. Q23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system? A23: I don't think that will save space on your local system because you have to create files locally before pushing them to Git. Q24: Can we use the query function? A24: Yes, absolutely. It's working like this. I'll comment it out, duplicate it, and comment it out once. Then we can run this. The query function is working. We have got the entire row where the city was. We can extract the population using this. It's working perfectly fine. It returned the population of Delhi. Q25: Do we need to mention values [square bracket] zero, values zero, if we are mentioning population only? A25: That's a very good question. If you use this, it will return a series (a Pandas term). It's just a column; it won't give you the exact value. We have to extract the zeroth value. We have to extract the values.
