now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?

Saved multiple times on the graded website as well submitted yes on the course tab but the score keeps resetting to 0 with no progress saved

@24f2006531 @GaURaVinDeX @shubham6 Please check this fix. It may solve your problem. GA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science @23f2005067 @23f2003751 I added a “Recent saves” feature. 
This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these. [image] Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic. 
Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs.
