Hello, I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still? @carlton @Jivraj image 1340×527 17.9 KB image 1002×560 51.4 KB

@Muthupalaniappan It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question. You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. Kind regards

Dear Sir, I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

sir can you please allow us to submit it . like open the seek portal for a few mins .
