be great if you demonstrate it in today’s live session at 8pm. Otherwise next week is all about project 2 discussion.

Thank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my Azure API URL would be exposed , and since it incurs costs per usage , I need to keep it secure. I’d prefer a private meet to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!

That’s amazing @23f2005702 , so far I have completed till 44 Qs and deployed it on azure too !! Mine is solving around 40 correctly out of these 44 (checked with another user’s login on the portal).

@Saransh_Saini I can’t join the meet since I’m out of station and don’t have PC access. I also have other coursework, so I’ll be available for a meet from the 31st onwards

Congrats for your project mate! Just wanted to ask how did you frame your questions for the Graded Assignments? Cause that will help me complete mine.
