Dear TDS Team, I have verified my submission, and my repository does include a Dockerfile , and the Docker image is accessible on DockerHub . Please find the attached screenshot as proof. Kindly review my submission again and let me know if any further action is needed. Looking forward to your confirmation.

@Saransh_Saini sir what should i do?

@carlton Kindly have a look into this.

Good Morning Sir, Sir even I am facing a similar issue, even though sanity check for docker image on docker hub was cleared but got a mail saying ‘dockerfile’ not present in the GitHub repo while it clearly was. Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you Satvik Sawhney 23f2003680

So the reason for the failure is: You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo.
