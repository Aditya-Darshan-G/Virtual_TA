)
 return log_time, method, url, status

with gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file:
 for entry in file:
 log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)
 if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:
 if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time:
 log_data.append(entry)

print(f"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}") ps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there!

Iâ€™m also facing same kind of issue in Q3, GA5, while cross checked answer from different methods getting same result 1603, which is showing incorrect. Kindly check this issue. Thanks

The same issue is being faced by many students, not only for this condition, but others as well. Please look into it

actually i got 130 as answer. but the answer accepted by the portal was 129. i felt like, i have to change one or two numbers front and back, i tried the same before.
