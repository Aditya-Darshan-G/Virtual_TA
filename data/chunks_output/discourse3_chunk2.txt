@23f3002530 Topic moved to the appropriate category in order to get faster responses. Please make it easier for others to help you, by ensuring that topics are created in the correct categories.

@23f3002530 Please refer to this post. Tds: assignment is not submitting Tools in Data Science Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.
