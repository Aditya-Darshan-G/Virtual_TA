of April. Kind regards

Hi @carlton sir, I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email. Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded? 1000041565 1280Ã—349 87.7 KB

Thanks we have made a correction and sent an email.
