ks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response. Regards, Lakshay
