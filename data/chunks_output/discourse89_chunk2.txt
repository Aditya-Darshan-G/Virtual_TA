sufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards
