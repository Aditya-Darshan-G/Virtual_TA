Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can complete the ROE faster and more effienctly? @all

Are we allowed to do that?

Yeah they said you can take help anyway possible even to ask a cat also or a pet, im not sure

Alright, works. I am down to collaborate.

Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this.

Sharing answers is asking for help

If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right? Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split the tasks efficiently and get it done. Thoughts?
